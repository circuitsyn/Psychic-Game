# Psychic-Game
##This is a Game where you guess the letter a computer is thinking!

In this game you will be guessing a letter that a computer has randomly selected. You will receive a certain amount of gueses. Once you deplete the guesses it is marked a loss. If you happen to guess the letter you get a +1 in the wins column! :sparkles:

Another component of the game is being able to see your guesses. The program prevents you from entering anything else except a letter a-z and it also converts any capital letters to lower case. There is a `console.log();` utilized to put out the answer for testing....or peeking! 

:sunglasses:*Give the game a whirl and see how well you can do!*:sunglasses:
